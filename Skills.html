<h2>Time Managment</h2>
<p>I have skills to manage the time in different way. For example, Google Calendar is one of the
    the tools that I use to manage my time. Also, I use Notion to manage my time. I use Notion for 
    my personal life like a second brain template. Another app that I use to manage my time is Todoist.
    Todoist is one the best app to make a to-do list. I use it to make a to-do list for my daily tasks.
    It's very helpful to manage my time and very quicly to add a task.

<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
<p>I have taken many courses about Cyber Security and how it works. I learned about encryptions
    and the types of it. Also, I learned about the types of attacks and how to prevent it.
    All the courses that I took is conceptual and I didn't take any practical courses.

<h2>Coding Languages</h2>
<p>I learned Python and Java in my freshman year. Python is the easy programming language to learn.
    and it has its own advantage and disadvantage. Data science and machine learning use Python and 
    there are other usage.
    <br>
    Java is the language that I understood the programming very deeply by conceptual and practical.
    And I knew what is OOP and UI like JavaFX. Java is of the one the languages that if you understand it,
    it will make your coding easier in other languages like JavaScript because 
    the syntax is similarly the same.</p>
